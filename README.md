# Create Toggle Keybind

## Synopsis
* Solves #2 
    - (Kind of)
    - No toggle for just radar.
* Press a keybind to toggle the cheat.

## Notes
* Requires Xlib (both `libx11-dev:i386` and `libx11-dev`, `# apt-get install libx11-dev libx11-dev:i386` on Debian based systems
* Bind in this Pull Request is Ctrl+Shift+X, but this is not optimal for gameplay.

## Known Bugs
* Does not work with Numlock enabled.
